# UX/UI Design Mastery Course - Quick Revision Notes

**Course:** [UX/UI Design Mastery Course](https://uxpeak.podia.com/)  
**Topic:** 10 Usability Heuristics by Jakob Nielsen

---

## Introduction

Usability is a critical aspect of product design, impacting:
- Product success and popularity
- User satisfaction and loyalty
- Overall user experience quality

**Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics** provide a framework for:
- Guiding UX design decisions
- Ensuring positive and intuitive user experiences
- Creating user-centered products that are both usable and effective

> **Note:** These heuristics are guidelines, not strict rules. Use judgment and user feedback to determine what's best for your specific product and target audience.

## 1. Visibility of System Status

### Principle
**The product should always keep users informed about what is going on through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.**

### Key Practices

#### Visual Feedback
- **Hover states**: Change button color when user hovers (indicates interactivity)
- **Click feedback**: Provide visual or auditory feedback when buttons are clicked
- **Loading indicators**: Show progress during operations
- **Status messages**: Display clear messages about system actions

### Examples
- Button color change on hover
- Loading spinner during data fetch
- Success checkmark after form submission
- Progress bar during file upload

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World

### Principle
**Make the product easy to understand by using language, concepts, and conventions familiar to users. Minimize cognitive effort by matching user expectations and mental models.**

### Key Elements

#### Natural Language
- Use familiar terms (e.g., "Login" instead of "Authenticate")
- Avoid jargon and technical language
- Use terminology users understand

#### Familiar Icons & Symbols
- **Trash icon** = Delete action
- **Magnifying glass** = Search
- **Envelope** = Email/Messages
- **Home icon** = Homepage

### Benefits
- Reduces learning curve
- Improves intuitive understanding
- Decreases cognitive load
- Faster task completion

## 3. User Control and Freedom

### Principle
**Users need to feel in charge of their experience. Allow users to undo, redo, and revise their actions.**

### Key Features

#### Essential Controls
- **Undo functionality**: Reverse accidental actions
- **Redo option**: Restore undone actions
- **Cancel buttons**: Exit without consequences
- **Edit capability**: Modify previous inputs

### Examples
